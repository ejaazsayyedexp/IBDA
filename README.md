Simple flask app that is predicting the food class and telling us the nutrient content from input image

Directly start the application by running the [app.py](./app.py) and the server will start running

**UPDATE!**: There is no model file. Due to the size (upto 200MB) of the model file, github had restricted so as to upload the rest of the files. Will soon update the model file with more efficient and concise loading methods.
